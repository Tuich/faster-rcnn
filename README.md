# faster-rcnn
faster rcnn for pytorch 1.x with kaiming initialization for resnet101 and L1 regularization borrow heavily from https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/tree/pytorch-1.0  
Changes are in the way that resnet is initialized and in the loss function.  
There will be a report for experiments results of my finetuning.
